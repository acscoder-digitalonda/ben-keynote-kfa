> Hey, Ben, how you doing? I am I'm sitting in a condo in Toronto, Canada, your country. I have a event this evening, and I was supposed to be on vacation with my family. We're supposed to come up here for my event and go to Niagara Falls and visit Toronto and do all these things, and then my son got the flu and ruined everything, so I had to fly up here by myself. And so I'm sitting in this sparse condo. I have been listening to your keynote. Actually listen to half of it yesterday and half of it just now, so I am locked in on it, and I'm going to offer some feedback as we go through, I'm going to play it and essentially stop it every now and again and give you some thoughts on, on on what I think, and maybe some areas where you could improve. So hopefully this helps. I'll probably end up doing this in two bits, like a half and a half, depending on, depending on how how I feel, essentially, if I lose my if I lose my energy where I suddenly need to use the restroom, I'll stop and create a second one. So maybe I'll get through the whole thing anyway. Thank you for giving me a chance to do this. And as always, I will give you positive feedback quite a bit along the way, when you're doing things, I like I believe in positive feedback as a means of letting people know what they're doing well that they sometimes don't know they're doing well. So that's important to be informed and also to improve consistency. So if you're doing something well, learning about it might make you do it even more often. So all right, enough. When do I get started? Here we go. Ben Nemtin

> Hello, everyone. I'm so excited to be here at fusion, as you heard. My name is Ben. I grew up in Victoria, British Columbia in Canada, and 17 years ago, three friends and I decided to go after 100 of our biggest dreams and help other people achieve their dreams. And through this journey, I learned this core truth that being

> so I like your opening. I think one of the things I'm going to say the whole way through your talk is that when you're telling stories and even doing what you just did, sort of your your energy level never changes. It's always upbeat. It's always positive. And I think that's important. But I think there are moments in the stories and other moments like this moment actually right now, where I think a slower, more deliberate pace can really serve you, like just this opening, for example. Let me go back and do it again. So we're just getting a sense of you coming on stage. We're just meeting you. Ben Nemtin

> Hello, everyone. I'm so excited to be here at fusion, as you heard. My name is Ben. I grew up in Victoria British Columbia, so

> I was like, okay, so what I'm doing is I'm going, Oh, Victoria, British Columbia. I go there every year. I work with Andrew Wilkinson and oh, I know that island. I like it. So, like, I've got thoughts in my head. And as you introduce ideas, people will also have thoughts, and especially because they haven't sort of fallen into a rhythm yet with you. I feel like the information you provide right here is so fast that I'm sort of keeping up, as opposed to, like building me in

> 
> so Canada and 17 years ago, three friends and I decided to go after 100 of our biggest dreams. Keynote Feedback Guy   
> 
> So that's a huge statement. So 17 years ago, three of my friends and I decided to go forth and conquer our 100 biggest dreams. I would just come out and say that a little more slowly, because it is a it's like a non common statement to hear in the world. It's one of those statements that sort of punches you in the face and says, it makes you go, what'd you just say? And so it comes out so quickly, I think you don't give the audience a chance to process what you just said. So I would actually say that slower, more deliberately and like just acknowledge that this is a thing the audience isn't expecting. They've never heard it before. They're going to have to process

> it and help other people achieve their dreams. And through this journey, I learned this core truth, that being true to yourself not only brings you the most happiness, but it also brings you the most success, and one of the quickest ways to discover your true self is by pursuing your passions and your purpose. So I want to tell you how I came to this truth by telling you my story. It's a rather unusual story. It's about how a simple bucket list changed my life forever, but it taught me some valuable lessons, that I think will impact the way that you do your job, unlock breakthroughs in your career and in your life, create a work life harmony that actually energizes you to be the truest version of yourself, as well as a process to achieve goals that feel impossible. So
> 
> Keynote Feedback Guy   
> 
> So here's my thought and this. Might be a little counter intuitive or goes against the grain of what most people would tell you, I think that whole opening can kind of go away. Here's the truth of it. I think that a minute into your story, if you paused and asked the audience, what did I say in the first 30 seconds of my speech, they would not be able to tell you what you said. I think what you're essentially doing is speaking big ideas. I'll use the word platitude, although that sort of is a little condescending to what you're actually doing. But you're speaking in these enormous ideas. But there's no grounding to those ideas, you're basically just saying things that quite honestly, now that I've been speaking for 30 seconds, I can't tell you what you just said, and so I know there's a belief that we come out and we sort of set some goals, set some ideas, give people a a runway for where we're going, like, here's what my goal is to accomplish today with you. I don't believe in it, because I think most of the time when we set those expectations, unless there's one specific, clear expectation that you can set at the top of a keynote, which is not the case here, I think you're better just diving into the story. I think the inclination people have is to think people want to know what they're going to get out of my talk. My opinion of all things is that the first and most important thing that they're going to get out of your talk is they're going to be entertained before anything else we have to entertain. If we're brilliant and wise and offer the most important idea there has ever been on the planet, it will fall to deaf ears and be forgotten if we're not entertaining. And so I don't think you have to lead with the idea of what you're about to get out of what I'm going to say or explain why you're about to tell a story. I think you just have to tell a story. I think your talk should actually start with your story, which is what I do all the time. When I give a keynote, I may say a few things before I begin speaking. Most of what I'm going to say is to just sort of like, let everyone settle into me. I'm probably going to crack a joke based upon the introduction I just received, or based upon something the speaker before me said, or something I noticed in the audience. You know, I'm going to quickly, but most assuredly, give people a sense of who I am, but then get right into the story, but I'm not going to give them an idea of what I'm about to teach them. I actually know from science. Science tells us one of the best ways to teach anyone anything is to surprise them. It is the number one way for an educator, a teacher of 27 years, to get kids to understand something is to surprise them, those aha moments when a kid understands why subtraction with regrouping makes sense like I understand it. It's not just caring, oh my gosh. 10s are moving over and becoming like it's an aha moment that we have, right? We have them all the time. They're the most surprising and most memorable moments. That's why movies like The Sixth Sense and fight club and usual suspects and even the Empire Strikes Back when we discover that, you know, Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker, Father, I was 11 years old when I saw that in a movie theater in Windsor, Rhode Island, my mind exploded, and it remains exploded today, right?

[REWRITE]:  
- **Introduction**: "Hey, Ben! I’m currently in Toronto for an event. I was supposed to be on vacation with my family, but my son got the flu, so here I am alone in this condo. I’ve been listening to your keynote and will share feedback as I go along. I believe in giving positive feedback to highlight what works well, so let’s dive in!"  
- **Opening**: "Hello, everyone! I’m thrilled to be here at Fusion. My name is Ben, and I grew up in Victoria, British Columbia. Seventeen years ago, my friends and I embarked on a journey to pursue 100 of our biggest dreams. This journey taught me a profound truth: being true to yourself brings both happiness and success."  
- **Key Message**: "I want to share how a simple bucket list transformed my life, revealing lessons that can unlock breakthroughs in your career and create a work-life harmony that energizes you."  
- **Engagement Tip**: "Before I continue, let me ask you: What do you think is the most surprising way to discover your true self?"  

[RATIONALE]: The original snippet had pacing issues, making it hard for the audience to absorb key points. By slowing down and engaging the audience with questions, the revised version enhances clarity and connection. Starting with a story rather than a summary captures attention and sets a more engaging tone.

## Scene 1
> It is the number one way for an educator, a teacher of 27 years, to get kids to understand something is to surprise them, those aha moments when a kid understands why subtraction with regrouping makes sense like I understand it. It's not just caring, oh my gosh. 10s are moving over and becoming like it's an aha moment that we have, right? We have them all the time. They're the most surprising and most memorable moments. That's why movies like The Sixth Sense and fight club and usual suspects and even the Empire Strikes Back when we discover that, you know, Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker, Father, I was 11 years old when I saw that in a movie theater in Windsor, Rhode Island, my mind exploded, and it remains exploded today, right? For most people, and perhaps someone your age. You knew it all your life, but I didn't when I was a kid. I'll never forget it. And so what I think we do here is by setting some expectations ahead of time. First of all, most importantly, they're forgotten. Nobody remembers them. Two minutes into your story, it's all gone. It was essentially a wasted 30 seconds that means nothing to anyone. I think also what it does is, if it's remembered, it steals from what you're about to offer. I think the best version of a keynote is you tell your story in an entertaining way. Nobody cares at that point what the purpose of it is, because you're entertaining them, right? So you're telling an entertaining, connective, relatable, interesting, amusing, exciting, suspenseful, filled with stakes and surprising story that gets people entertained and they don't realize that what I'm actually doing is laying the groundwork for the entire idea, lesson, you know framework that I'm about to present to you, but when they don't see it coming, that's the best, because they've been entertained. They fall in love with you. When you tell a story, you release five chemicals into the brain. All five speakers exceptionally well. They improve comprehension, they improve connection. They make people feel better about themselves, better about the world that they're living in. It's really powerful. So you get all of that great brain chemistry going, you open with the story, or as close to the story as possible, without setting those preset guidelines or those those goals for the talk, mostly because they're forgotten, but in part because they. Feel surprised, and they prevent you from getting to the story as quickly as I think you need to. Boy, was that. A lot of ways to say I think the first 30 seconds of your talk can go right away, and you can start with your great

> story. Before I get to those takeaways, I'll tell you my story, yes, and tell the story properly. Keynote Feedback Guy   
> 
> So right there, just not to harp on it, but you can just quiz your audience at this point, how many of you are or a minute later, how many of you remember those takeaways? Right? Why are we giving takeaways before we've gotten to the point where there is a takeaway, right? The idea of a takeaway is you're going to take a thing and walk away with it and have it forever. Why are we offering it at the top of a talk? It belongs the end of the talk, right? So we don't want to present takeaways at the beginning. It's the equivalent of, I know I'm hopping. It's the equivalent of saying, Let me tell you a story about how my wife and I fell in love, right? I have just ruined everything for you like you now know what's coming, right? You know that when a woman appears in my story, that's the woman who's going to be his wife, as opposed to, if I just told you a story and a woman appeared in the story, you wouldn't know who the hell she is. Is she a bad guy or a good guy? Is he going to try to get with her but not get with her right? Is she worth getting with right? All of these things we don't want preambles that steal from the surprises and the enlightenments that we're about to offer. So again, I started here
> 
> Ben Nemtin   
> 
> really, I need to bring you back to my high school graduation. This was in Victoria, British Columbia, and at that time in my life, I was very happy, very happy. Why? Well, I just graduated. I was going on to my next stage of life. I was happy because I'd worked very hard to earn an academic scholarship to a great university in my hometown. But the real reason I was happy I had just learned that I was about to achieve my biggest dream, and that was playing in the World Cup of rugby. Keynote Feedback Guy   
> 
> Great. It's a good opening here. This is what I would love you to start with. I would actually, in terms of storytelling, I'd rather have you establish a scene right now, what you're doing is a flyover of your story. You're not settling me into the story, right? You gave me a date and you gave me a feeling, and you gave me a reason why I would rather have a moment where, you know it's this year and I'm happy. I'm sitting at my dining room table opening a letter, and the letter is from a college and as I unfold the paper and I read it, I see that I have been accepted. I've been accepted to university with a scholarship. And even more important than the scholarship, what I also know about this university is rugby. When we settle people into scenes, location and action, that's the trick. Tell us where you are and tell us what's happening. Take the idea that you have, which you're presenting as a drones view. Fly over. You're flying over the story. Rather than settling in. Settle us into a moment. Choose a moment that is emblematic of what you're saying, and allow us to be in that moment. That's what creates unforgettableness. You're sort of reporting on your life right now. Actually, it's exactly what you're doing. You're reporting on your life. You're not really storytelling. Storytelling is like in the movies. Put me into a scene, right? I'm standing outside my mailbox. I'm about to open it inside. Could be the letter I have been waiting for for three months. It is the letter that will determine my future. It is the letter being sent by some entity somewhere that doesn't know me yet, but might someday, and I need to know what it's going to say. That is suspense, that surprise, that stakes, right? That's in the scene. Now. I see you at a mailbox, right? Or I see you at a table, or I see you opening a letter, I drop me into the scene rather than staying above the scene. Ben Nemtin   
> 
> Yeah. So in Canada, rugby is a huge sport. It's probably the third biggest sport in Canada, behind hockey and hockey
> 
> Keynote Feedback Guy   
> 
> a good joke. Well done. There's probably a joke here about rugby too. In Canada, you don't need to make the joke. But in the United States, a lot of people don't know what rugby is, and I only have a vague understanding of rugby. There's a comedy trick that I teach people a strategy called definitions. And definitions as we take a concept that someone might not be familiar with, or someone is familiar with, and we reduce it down to its most basic form. And when we do that, we often create humor, and at the same time we define something. So for example, like in this condo, there's windows right here, right? And so if I'm thinking about what a window is, reduce it down to its basic function, a window is a hole in a wall that prevents me from moving around this condo naked, right? That's a amusing way to define a window. A window is a hole in the wall that shows me where I wish I could be instead of being here, right? That's another amusing way. So rugby has the same thing, right? You're going to just find rugby. I know it's coming up here. Hold on,
> 
> Ben Nemtin   
> 
> that's pretty big. And I played the fly half position. For those of you that aren't familiar with rugby, I can give you a football analogy for that position, the fly.

[DIAGNOSIS]: #Storytelling #Engagement #Surprise #AudienceConnection #Clarity #Pacing

[REWRITE]: 
To truly engage students, an educator must create those "aha" moments—like when a child grasps the concept of subtraction with regrouping. These moments are akin to the shocking twists in films like *The Sixth Sense* or *Fight Club*. I remember watching *The Empire Strikes Back* at 11 and being blown away by the revelation of Darth Vader's identity. Such surprises stick with us. 

Instead of starting with takeaways that audiences forget moments later, dive straight into your story. For instance, picture this: I'm at my dining room table, opening a letter from a university. As I unfold it, I see I've been awarded a scholarship. More importantly, I know this university is renowned for rugby, my passion. This scene immerses the audience, creating suspense and connection. 

In Canada, rugby is a major sport, often overshadowed by hockey. To clarify for those unfamiliar, think of rugby as a mix of football and soccer—intense and strategic. 

[RATIONALE]: 
The rewrite emphasizes storytelling by immersing the audience in a vivid scene, enhancing engagement and connection. It eliminates unnecessary preambles, focusing on impactful moments that resonate. This approach fosters surprise and clarity, making the message memorable and relatable.
